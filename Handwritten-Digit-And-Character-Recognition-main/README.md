## What is Deep Learning?

Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks.

## What is neural networks?

Neural networks reflect the behavior of the human brain, allowing computer programs to recognize patterns and solve common problems in the fields of AI, machine learning, and deep learning.

## Which machine learning algorithm is suitable for handwritten character recognition?

**Connectionist Temporal Classification(CTC)** is an algorithm used to deal with tasks like speech recognition, handwriting recognition etc.

## How Deep learning is used for recognition of hand-written characters?

## What is Convolution?

Convolution preserves the relationship between pixels by learning image features using small squares of input data. It is a mathematical operation that takes two inputs such as image matrix and a filter or kernel.

## Libraries used:

- Keras - Used to download datasets for training.
- Tensorflow - Used for Deep Learning algorithms.
- Opencv - Used to train model.
- Joblib - Used to save the trained model.
